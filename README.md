Just a silly project to learn/practice Spring(boot) framework and React.js.

## Features:

None so far :(

## Goals/To Do/Road map:
* Be able to tell if doing *bad*, *ok* or *good*;
* Store how you doin'
* Optionally describe how you feel
* Add tags for tracking the states. E.g.: 
    * drank too much (alcohol); 
    * went to bed late (sleep);
    * got promoted (work);
* User based feelings (login/auth/session etc)
* Calendar view
* Statistics(?). E.g.: 
    * For what reason (tag) were you most in a *bad* day? 
    * What made you feel *good*?
